# yt-search

An app which scrapes YouTube APIs

## TODO
- minify and gzip html files when serving them
- optimize the file parsing
- google adwords

## Test videos
There are no tests for the logic so far. If we wanted to make tests, here is a list of videos to use:
- `MBnnXbOM5S4` control example
- `wL7tSgUpy8w` has auto generated subtitles but there's only instrumental music
- `3x1b_S6Qp2Q` for benchmarking large videos
